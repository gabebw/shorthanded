# Shorthanded

Automatically deploy an app to Heroku and add a CNAME for it in DNSimple. Go
from zero to `http//dry-pine.mysite.com` in under a minute.

This is part of a larger project to make it easy to automatically deploy one
application for multiple people, each of whom gets a unique URL for their
deployment of the application. The unique URL is a Heroku-esque subdomain like
`dry-pine` or `icy-glitter` plus a domain that you provide.

## The full workflow

1. A request hits the API (see below for more about the API).
2. A Heroku app is created with a semi-random name. It's only semi-random
   because it has a (configurable) prefix like "shorty-" or "custom-" to make
   generated apps easy to find in your Heroku console.
3. As part of the app creation, the Heroku app deploys the .tar.gz containing
   the code of another app. The URL of the .tar.gz is given by
   `$URL_OF_TAR_GZ_TO_DEPLOY`). The .tar.gz must have an [app.json] in the root,
   which will tell Heroku what environment variables to set and generally how to
   deploy that app.
4. A random Heroku-esque subdomain is created on your DNSimple domain.
5. The subdomain is mapped to the Heroku application
6. Voila, it's all wired up, from DNSimple -> Heroku.

## What's the API?

`POST /apps`

Required headers:

* `Accept: application/vnd.shorthanded+json; version=1`
* `X-App-Secret: {Whatever you set $HEADER_SECRET to in the env}`

Returns JSON.

#### Success

Status code: 201 Created

```json
{
  "url": "http://dry-pine.mysite.com"
}
```

#### Failure

Status code: 502 Bad Gateway

Failure is directly from Heroku's create action, because that's the only thing
that should fail, and even that is unlikely, but here's an example:

```json
{
  "id": "invalid_params",
  "message": "Name is already taken"
}
```

The `id` and `message` keys should always be present.

## OK, how do I deploy this?

You can push it to Heroku like any other app. Most of the functionality is
controlled by environment variables:

| Name | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HEROKU_APP_NAME_PREFIX` | A short (<= 7 characters) string that will be used as the prefix of each Heroku app to make autogenerated apps easy to find in the Heroku console. If  you want a longer prefix, change how long a SecureRandom string gets generated in HerokuAppNameGenerator. | shorty- |
| `HEROKU_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Get one using instructions in [their docs]. | aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa |
| `URL_OF_TAR_GZ_TO_DEPLOY` | Heroku has an API to take in .tar.gz of apps with an [app.json] in the root. If you add an `app.json` to your app on GitHub, GitHub will gladly generate a .tar.gz for you on the fly using a URL like `https://github.com/gabebw/shorthanded/archive/master.tar.gz` | https://github.com/gabebw/shorthanded/archive/master.tar.gz |
| `DNSIMPLE_DOMAIN` | The domain name (WITHOUT a scheme like `http://`) to add a subdomain for. Must have DNS controlled by DNSimple. |  `example.com` |
| `DNSIMPLE_DOMAIN_TOKEN` | DNSimple has a couple different ways to authenticate against [their API]. Shorthanded uses the domain token because it gives the least access to a user's account. You can find it under the "settings" for a specific domain on DNSimple's website. | 3125f1af24979e2f821ef829bc8040a5 |
| `HEADER_SECRET` | A secret token that must be sent with the headers of every request. It prevents random people from creating a lot of Heroku apps on your behalf. | secret |

## Local development

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

[this script]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].

## Deploying

If you have previously run the `./bin/setup` script,
you can deploy to staging and production with:

    $ ./bin/deploy staging
    $ ./bin/deploy production
